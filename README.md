# ASP.NET Core Identity 

ASP.NET Core Identity is the membership system for building ASP.NET Core web applications, including membership, login, and user data. ASP.NET Core Identity allows you to add login features to your application and makes it easy to customize data about the logged in user.

In this project, I made examples such as user create, signin, signout, create role, assign role, cookie configuration , authorize with ASP.NET Core Identity Framework.
